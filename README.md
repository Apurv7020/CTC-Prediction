Conclusion

In this analysis, we performed a comprehensive exploration and modeling process for predicting CTC (Cost to Company) using various regression models. The steps included:
Data Exploration and Preprocessing: We started by loading the dataset, handling potential issues such as missing values or outliers, and preparing the data for modeling.

Correlation Analysis: By examining correlations between features, we gained insights into feature importance and their relationship to the target variable. This guided the feature selection process for our models.

Model Training and Evaluation: We trained multiple regression models, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Bagging Regressor, and RandomForest Regressor. Each model was evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score for both training and testing datasets.

Boosting Techniques: We also explored boosting methods such as AdaBoost, GradientBoosting, and XGBoost to improve the prediction accuracy and reduce error rates. These techniques were applied and similarly evaluated with MSE and R² metrics.

Key Findings

Model Performance: Among the regression models, RandomForest and GradientBoosting provided better accuracy in predicting CTC, with lower MSE and higher R² scores. These models showed greater potential for deployment in real-world prediction scenarios.

Impact of Ensemble Methods: The application of ensemble methods (Bagging, Boosting) helped improve the predictive power of individual models. The use of techniques like Random Forest and XGBoost demonstrated the importance of combining multiple trees to achieve better results.

Feature Importance: Through the models, certain features stood out as more important in predicting the target (CTC). These insights can be valuable for future feature engineering and refining the prediction model.
